    <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
    <p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
    <p>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
    <p>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
    <p>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—</p>
    <p>Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
    <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
    <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
    <p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
    <p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</p>
    <p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</p>
    <p>Merely this and nothing
      <a href="../page4/index.html">more.</a></p>

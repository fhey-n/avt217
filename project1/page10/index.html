    <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</p>
    <p>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</p>
    <p>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</p>
    <p>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</p>
    <p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</p>
    <p>Shall be <a class="ex2" href="../index.html">lifted—nevermore</a>!</p>
  </body>

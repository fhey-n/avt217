    <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</p>
    <p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</p>
    <p>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
    <p>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—</p>
    <p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
    <p>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>
    <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</p>
    <p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</p>
    <p>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</p>
    <p>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,</p>
    <p>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,</p>
    <p>She shall press, ah, <a href="../page8/index.html">nevermore</a>!</p>

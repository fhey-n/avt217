    <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</p>
    <p>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
    <p>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</p>
    <p>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—</p>
    <p>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</p>
    <p>’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
    <p>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;</p>
    <p>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</p>
    <p>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—</p>
    <p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—</p>
    <p>Perched, and sat, and nothing
      <a class="ex2" href="../page5/index.html">more.</a></p>

    <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</p>
    <p>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</p>
    <p>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</p>
    <p>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—</p>
    <p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
    <p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
    <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
    <p>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</p>
    <p>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</p>
    <p>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—</p>
    <p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
    <p>With such name as “<a href="../page6/index.html">Nevermore.</a>”</p>

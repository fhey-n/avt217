    <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</p>
    <p>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
    <p>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—</p>
    <p>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—</p>
    <p>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”</p>
    <p>Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</p>
    <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</p>
    <p>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</p>
    <p>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
    <p>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—</p>
    <p>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</p>
    <p>Of ‘<a class="ex2" href="../page7/index.html">Never—nevermore</a>’.”</p>

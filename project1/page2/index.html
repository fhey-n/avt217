    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</p>
    <p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
    <p>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
    <p>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</p>
    <p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
    <p>Nameless here for evermore.</p>
    <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
    <p>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
    <p>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</p>
    <p>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</p>
    <p>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</p>
    <p>This it is and nothing
      <a href="../page3/index.html">more.</a>”</p>
